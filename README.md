# Our approach
## Machine Learning Models
* XGBoost for Scenarios 3 and 4
  - xgboost 1.7.5 [[1]](#1)
  - Dependencies: see requirements.txt
  - hyper-parameter tuning using Hyperopt 0.2.7 [[2]](#2)
  - Metric: RMSE

* Multivaraite Time Series Transformers for Scenarios 1 and 2
  - torch 1.13.1+cu117 [[3]](#3)
  - torchaudio 0.13.1+cu117
  - torchvision 0.14.1+cu117
  - mvts_transformer [[4]](#4)
  - standarlization normalization
  - RAdam optimizer
  - Metric: MSE
  
## Data Preprocessing
* Processing physiodata
* Reducing frequency
* data merge
* dynamic feature 

# Repository content
* "data_processing" folder:
  - *Preprocess & concat.ipynb*: Python code for processing physio data and merging physio and affect data
  - *extract_dynamic_features.R*: R code for extracting dynamic features based on processed physio data
* "results.zip": result files with predictions. Use the original naming and structure of directories, e.g., ./results/scenario_2/fold_3/test/annotations/sub_0_vid_2.csv
* "models" folder:
  - *XGBoost*: code and dependencies for fitting XGBoost models
  - *ts_transformer*: code and dependencies for fitting transformer models
